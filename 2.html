      <h1>To My Love,</h1>
      <p>Every day spent with you is a reminder of how incredibly lucky I am to have you by my side. You are my heart, my soul, and everything in between. Together, we create magic. I love you more than words can say. Happy Birthday, my forever love.</p>
     
      <p>
        Two years. Two years since the universe conspired to bring you into my life—since that fateful moment when you turned back, introduced yourself, and unknowingly etched your name into my soul. I still remember it vividly: the way your eyes sparkled like galaxies, as if the stars themselves envied your brilliance. That moment, Sreeja, was my undoing—or perhaps, it was the beginning of my becoming. A part of me surrendered to you that day, willingly and completely, as though my heart recognized its home for the first time.
        
        These two years have been a canvas of love, painted with hues of joy and shades of regret. I’ve stumbled, faltered, and failed you in ways that haunt me. I didn’t always treat you as you deserved, and for that, I carry a weight I can never fully shed. But Sreeja, in your boundless grace, you loved me still—patiently, unconditionally. You stood by me like the steady shore that holds the waves, no matter how turbulent they may be. You are the light in my darkest nights, the melody in my silences, the heartbeat that keeps my chaos alive.
        
        You are the poetry I never thought I could write, the song my soul hums in quiet moments. With every glance, every touch, you stitch together the pieces of my broken self, crafting a love so profound it feels like the universe whispers our names together in the stars. Your laughter is the music I’d choose over any symphony, your presence the warmth that turns cold winters into spring. I’ve realized, Sreeja, that loving you isn’t just something I do—it’s the very essence of who I am.
        
        How foolish I was to let the whispers of others cloud the truth of your heart. How blind to not see the purity of your love when it was the only constant in my ever-changing world. I never asked for your side, never sought your truth. For that, Sreeja, I am deeply sorry. If I could rewrite those moments, I would ink them with trust and carve them with the certainty of your love. But this life… this life feels unworthy of you. Perhaps, in another, I could be the woman who deserves the depth of your soul.
        
        And you, my love, my beautiful Sreeja… you speak of flaws, of imperfections that only you can see. But let me tell you what I see. I see a masterpiece—a body that moves with grace, a soul that radiates warmth, and a presence that feels like poetry personified. You are the very definition of beauty to me, not by any worldly standard, but because you are you. Every curve, every smile, every word you utter is a symphony that plays endlessly in my heart.
        
        Sreeja, I love you—in ways that words will always fall short of capturing. You are my every thought, my every dream, my every reason to believe in the magic of this world. On this day, the universe blessed the world with you, and I am endlessly grateful to share even a sliver of that blessing.
        
        You know, my love, I tried to create something for you—something cute, something as breathtakingly beautiful as you are. I poured my heart onto the canvas, but the result fell short—it turned out so ugly, almost laughable. Yet, in your embrace, even the ugliest of things transforms into something extraordinary. You have that magic, Sreeja—the kind that turns imperfections into wonders, the kind that makes me believe that even I, with all my flaws, could be worthy of your love.
        
        Happy birthday, my love. Here’s to you, to the wonder that you are, and to a love that transcends time itself. You are my forever, Sreeja, and I am yours for as long as this heart beats.
